                        <p>When reaching out to publishers, explain why you would be a great fit to write for them. Share samples of your work or ideas for post topics.</p>
                        <p class="note">Focus on sites read by your ideal clients instead of spamming random blogs.</p>

                        <p>Post regularly on your services, advice, behind-the-scenes of projects, or industry insights. Mix in some personal posts to show your personality. Use relevant hashtags and engage with others in your field.</p>

                        <p>Start by researching relevant keywords. Think about terms clients would search when looking for someone offering your services. Use these throughout your website content, page titles, headers, URLs, and meta descriptions.</p>
                        <p>Also optimize your freelance profiles on platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and Fiverr with these keywords.</p>
                        <p>Produce blog posts and videos that target specific keyword terms. Link to this content from other sites when possible.</p>
                        <h3>4. Build a Portfolio</h3>
                        <img class="indeximg" src="/uploads/2023/9/portfolio-example-400x.webp" alt="Portfolio example">
                        <p>Having an impressive portfolio showcasing your best freelance work makes you appear significantly more credible to potential clients. It provides examples of the value you can provide.</p>
                        <p>Make sure your portfolio website or professional profiles highlight specific projects, with images/videos, testimonials, and explanations of the services you provided.</p>
                        <p class="note">Clients want to quickly see your abilities in action, not just generic claims about your skills.</p>
                        <p>Also use your portfolio when applying to job postings on sites like <a href="https://linkedin.com/" aria-label="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>. Hiring managers want concrete examples of prior work. So include a link to your portfolio in your application.</p>
                        <h3>5. Networking</h3>
                        <img class="indeximg" src="/uploads/2023/9/networking-400x.webp" alt="Networking">
                        <p>Networking online or in-person within your industry's community can lead to game-changing connections as a freelancer.</p>
                        <p>Consider going to conferences or events, connect on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook Groups, and Slack channels. Provide value by sharing insights.</p>
                        <p>The more people encounter you and your expertise, the more likely your services stay top of mind when they need help on projects.</p>
                        <p>Networking is also a two-way street. Ask others for advice to help grow your freelancing skills. Learn what challenges they face. Offer support where you can.</p>
                        <p>When networking, focus on giving before getting. If your contributions are helpful, opportunities to work together often follow.</p>
                        <p>Done right, networking builds relationships, raises awareness, generates referrals, and positions you as an authority worth hiring.</p>
                        <h3>6. Ads</h3>
                        <img class="indeximg" src="/uploads/2023/9/digital-ads-400x.webp" alt="Ads">
                        <p>Running targeted ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Google can expand your promotional reach as a freelancer.</p>
                        <p>With ads, you pay to boost the visibility of your services. You can precisely target an audience by location, interests, job titles, and more.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you do freelance web development, run ads promoting your services that only appear to people with developer job titles. Or target your designs ads based on interests like "web design trends".</p>
                        <p>This gets your service in front of highly qualified leads actively searching for someone to hire. The investment can yield big returns in terms of new client acquisition.</p>
                        <p>Just focus on a narrow, highly relevant target audience instead of trying to appeal to everyone. Track conversion rates to optimize your ads over time.</p>
