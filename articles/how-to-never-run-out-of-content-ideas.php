                        <p>Coming up with ideas for content can be a struggle, whether you're writing <a href="https://profitproton.com/articles/the-12-best-blogging-niches-with-low-competition-in-2023" aria-label="The best blogging niches with low competition">blog posts</a>, making Instagram posts, or creating any other type of media that requires creativity.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, creativity runs dry sometimes. We all hit walls where we just can't seem to think of what to write or post next. But having a reliable system and strategy in place is the key to never running out of content ideas again.</p>
                        <p>The process outlined in this article will work for all types of content creation, from blogs to social media and more. By following a few simple steps, you'll always have plenty of fresh ideas ready to turn into great content your audience will love.</p>
                        <h2>3 Steps to Never Run Out of Content Ideas Again</h2>
                        <h3>Pick a Main Niche</h3>
                        <p>The first step is to pick a main niche to focus on. This will be the foundation of your content creation.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you love gaming, you could make that your niche. Gaming is a massive industry with tons of potential topics to cover.</p>
                        <p>Make sure to pick a niche you're truly passionate about, since that passion will come through in your content. Your niche should also have enough depth that you can create content around it consistently.</p>
                        <p>Once you've picked your main niche, you can move onto the next step.</p>
                        <h3>Divide the Niche into Categories</h3>
                        <p>Once you've chosen your main niche, the next step is to divide it into logical categories and subcategories. Sticking with gaming as the example, you could split it into categories like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Console gaming (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, etc)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>PC gaming</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Mobile gaming</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Game genres (FPS, RPG, strategy, etc)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Gaming hardware</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Game studios/developers</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Gaming culture and news</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The goal here is to break your broad niche down into more specific categories that each provide lots of potential content angles. This makes it easier to come up with focused post ideas later. Spend some time brainstorming all the possible subsections of your main niche. The more thorough you are here, the more value you'll get out of the next step.</p>
                        <h3>Split Each Category into Several Content Types</h3>
                        <p>The last step is to take each category you came up with and split it into different types of content you could create.</p>
                        <p>For example, in the console gaming category, you could have content types like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Provide your hands-on review of the latest PS5, Xbox Series X, etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Top products/services:</strong> Top 10 best PS5 games, best Xbox accessories, etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>How-to guides:</strong> How to set up your Nintendo Switch, how to link accounts on PlayStation, etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> Best practices, hidden features, performance optimizations, etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Latest news:</strong> Announcements, leaks, rumors, and other news around console gaming.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other categories like PC gaming, game genres, and gaming culture would have their own distinct content types too.</p>
                        <p>Having these core templates gives you endless combinations to write about. And whenever you need ideas, just consult your categories and content types for inspiration!</p>
