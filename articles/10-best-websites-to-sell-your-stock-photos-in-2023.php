                        <p>In this article, we will look at the 11 best online marketplaces to sell stock photos in 2024 and compare the royalty percentages they offer you as a seller, as well as considering their overall potential to sell pictures for money.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.stocksy.com/" aria-label="Stocksy">Stocksy</a> provides the highest royalty rates as a stock photo site, offering photographers 50-75% commissions on each sale. However, when considering all aspects including number of users, licensing options, ease of use, and more, <a href="https://elements.envato.com/" title="Envato Elements">Envato Elements</a> stands out as the best overall platform for selling stock photos.</p>
                        <h2>The Best Websites to Sell Stock Photos</h2>
                        <p>We will explore the pros and cons of each site to help you determine where to license your images for the highest earnings and visibility.</p>
                        <h3>1. Shutterstock</h3>
                        <img src="/uploads/2023/8/shutterstock-contributor-400x.webp" alt="Shutterstock Contributor">
                        <p><strong>Royalty:</strong> 15-40%</p>
                        <p>Shutterstock is one of the most popular places to sell photos. With millions of images available, competition is very high between photographers looking to sell photographs on this platform. So while Shutterstock offers a place for photographers to sell their work and earn money online, it may not be the best place due to relatively low royalty payments. Photographers looking to start a photography business by selling their stock photos may find it difficult to stand out and attract buyers on this site.</p>
                        <p>Given the high competition, Shutterstock likely isn&apos;t the best option for those wanting to start selling their photos online unless they have exceptionally unique high-quality images. Photographers looking to sell images online may have better options to showcase and sell their best work.</p>

                        <h3>2. Alamy</h3>
                        <img src="/uploads/2023/8/alamy-400x.webp" alt="Alamy">
                        <p><strong>Royalty:</strong> 50%</p>
                        <p>Alamy provides generous royalty payments to contributing photographers. Their licensing fees tend to be higher than other stock platforms too. This means that while the amount of sales may be lower, each sale earns you significantly more.</p>
                        <p>So although earnings per sale are high, you may experience fewer frequent sales compared to platforms with cheaper subscription models or licenses.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately Alamy can be a stock photography site if you have unique content that buyers are willing to pay premium rates for. But for newer or inexperienced stock photographers, other platforms may be a better fit for you.</p>

                        <h3>3. Adobe Stock</h3>
                        <img src="/uploads/2023/8/adobe-stock-400x.webp" alt="Adobe Stock">
                        <p><strong>Royalty:</strong> 33%</p>
                        <p>Adobe Stock offers a great user experience for photographers looking to sell photography. Uploading photos and managing your portfolio is straightforward and intuitive through their seller tools. Adobe Stock photographers also receive free access to Adobe Portfolio, which allows you to create personalized online galleries and websites.</p>
                        <p>The site provides a respectable 33% royalty on sales, which lands in the middle range compared to other top platforms.</p>
                        <p>Adobe has the advantage of integration with Creative Cloud, allowing millions of existing users easy access to Stock&apos;s image library. This built-in customer base makes it relatively easy to get your photos seen and potentially sold to Adobe&apos;s large number of users.</p>

                        <h3>4. iStock</h3>
                        <img src="/uploads/2023/8/istock-400x.webp" alt="iStock">
                        <p><strong>Royalty:</strong> 15%</p>
                        <p>iStock is focused on having a great stock photo buying experience, as shown by their high customer rating. However, this means lower royalty earnings for photographers, with iStock only offering a 15% royalty rate.</p>
                        <p>So while the royalty percentage is on the lower end, photographers can still make money on iStock by providing images that the large buyer base is actively looking for. The key is regularly adding new content that fits what sells best on this stock photography website.</p>
                        <p class="note">Some sellers make over $20k on iStock by regularly uploading a diverse range of high-demand images.</p>

                        <img src="/uploads/2023/8/etsy-400x.webp" alt="Etsy">
                        <p><strong>Royalty:</strong> Takes 20 cents and 3.5%</p>
                        <p>Etsy isn&apos;t a traditional stock photo website, but it does provide creative ways for photographers to sell their images and earn money beyond just digital licensing.</p>
                        <p>Photographers can open their own Etsy shop to sell photo prints, canvases, mugs, t-shirts and more featuring their photography. This gives you full control to set your own prices and offer unique physical products showcasing your best photographs.</p>

                        <p>Dreamstime provides user-friendly tools for stock photographers to upload, manage and sell their portfolio.</p>
                        <p>In terms of features, Dreamstime does not stand out as particularly unique compared to other leading marketplaces.</p>
                        <p>Royalty rates starting from 25% are decent, but not the highest commissions. Overall, Dreamstime operates as a solid stock agency that gets the job done.</p>

                        <p>Marketing efforts fall heavily on contributors though. Without much promotion of your work, it can be difficult to stand out amongst other sellers. SEO and social media skills are highly beneficial to sell your photographs.</p>

                        <h3>10. Stocksy</h3>
                        <img src="/uploads/2023/8/stocksy-400x.webp" alt="Stocksy">
                        <p><strong>Royalty:</strong> 50-75%</p>
                        <p>Stocksy is one of the best stock photo sites for photographers to maximize income from selling their images. This website provides incredibly high royalties between 50-75% to contributors.</p>
                        <p>Stocksy has built an impressive niche customer base that earns photographers good money, unlike massive sites like Shutterstock where there is more competition. The smaller platform makes it easier for sellers to gain exposure and make sales.</p>
                        <p>However, Stocksy only accepts around 10% of sellers after an application process. So you need exceptionally high-quality photographs just to get started selling on Stocksy. But for the photographer with high-quality photos looking to sell their photographs and earn high royalty payments, Stocksy is likely the top choice.</p>
