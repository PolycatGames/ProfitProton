Selling prints online can bring in a few hundred dollars a month on the low end but can scale to thousands for those who build large shops. Local printing services can make $50-100k+ yearly with multiple printers and clients. Information products like courses can make six figures if marketed well. Overall earnings range widely based on your goals."
