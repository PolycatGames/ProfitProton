  "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "The amount of starting capital required depends heavily on the type of business. Many online and service-based businesses can get started for less than $1,000. Product-based businesses generally need more upfront capital to fund production. It's best to start small and grow organically as you begin generating revenue."
