  "acceptedAnswer": {
    "@type": "Answer",
    "text": "For business owners, ChatGPT Plus is likely worth the $20 monthly investment. The priority access alone helps you get more done faster when the free version is bogged down. And the ability to have back-and-forth dialogues with the AI can boost productivity. But the free model works just fine for more casual users."
